It's my individual and original work, a workpiece developed as a part of my hobby. 
100 % original and genuine A3 design. Hence got it copyright. 
Almost all the editing has been done on a SMARTPHONE- Lenovo K8. 
The term BLAZING Edition has got a matching Gradient Effort, making it appear that the fading light is due to the fire, with respect to the Fire background. 
The texture used on the logo are from free sources. 
An additional greenish layer has been added to change the look further to a next level.
